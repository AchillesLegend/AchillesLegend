I'm seeking a skilled modder with experience in creating modifications for the Anno 1800 game.
The ideal candidate should have a passion for gaming and a strong understanding of game mechanics, as well as proficiency in programming or scripting languages relevant to modding.
You will be responsible for developing and implementing new features, enhancing gameplay, and ensuring compatibility with existing game elements.
If you have a creative mindset and a track record of successful mods, we would love to hear from you!
